# Summarizing Student Data

We begin by loading the tidyverse as we will use it throughout this assignment.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```


## Task 1: Read in the Data and Modify

We start Task 1 by reading in the data in two different ways.

First, we modify the code provided with the download to read in the data from a local file source and combine the two data frames. We use local paths.

```{r}
d1=read.table("student-mat.csv",sep=";",header=TRUE)
d2=read.table("student-por.csv",sep=";",header=TRUE)

d3=merge(d1,d2,by=c("school","sex","age","address","famsize","Pstatus","Medu","Fedu","Mjob","Fjob","reason","nursery","internet"))

head(d3)
```

Second, we read in the data sets separately and then combine them using functions from the tidyverse. We use `inner_join()` on the variables used in the code from the website

```{r}
data_mat <- read_delim('student-mat.csv', delim = ';')
data_por <- read_delim('student-por.csv', delim = ';')
data_join1 <- inner_join(data_mat, data_por, by=c("school","sex","age","address","famsize","Pstatus","Medu","Fedu","Mjob","Fjob","reason","nursery","internet"))

data_join1
```

The problem we see is that row 79 of `data_mat` matches multiple rows of `data-por`. This means rows won't be joined in a one-to-one fashion. 

Now we do an inner join on the math and portuguese data by all variables except `G1`, `G2`, `G3`, `paid`, and `absences`. 

```{r}
data_join2 <- inner_join(data_mat, data_por, by = names(data_mat)[!(names(data_mat) %in% c('G1', 'G2', 'G3', 'paid', 'absences'))])
data_join2
```

As expected, there are 38 variables. 28 are the matched columns which we specified in the join. The remaining 10 variables comprise the 5 pairs of G1, G2, G3, paid, and absences variables, where one member of a pair is from the math data (those ending in .x) and the other member of the pair is from the portuguese data (those ending in .y). 

To complete this task, we choose 4 categorical variables we are interested in and convert these to factors in each of `data_mat`, `data_por`, and `data_join2` tibbles. We will chose `school`, `sex`, `Medu`, and `Mjob` as our categorical variables. We also choose names for some of the levels that are more interpretable than the default names.

```{r}
data_mat <- data_mat |>
  mutate(school = as.factor(school),
         sex = factor(sex, levels = c('F', 'M'), labels = c('Female', 'Male')),
         Medu = factor(Medu, levels = c(4, 3, 2, 1, 0), labels = c('Higher_Ed', 'Secondary', '5th_to_9th', 'Primary', 'None')),
         Mjob = as.factor(Mjob))

data_por <- data_por |>
  mutate(school = as.factor(school),
         sex = factor(sex, levels = c('F', 'M'), labels = c('Female', 'Male')),
         Medu = factor(Medu, levels = c(4, 3, 2, 1, 0), labels = c('Higher_Ed', 'Secondary', '5th_to_9th', 'Primary', 'None')),
         Mjob = as.factor(Mjob))

data_join2 <- data_join2 |>
  mutate(school = as.factor(school),
         sex = factor(sex, levels = c('F', 'M'), labels = c('Female', 'Male')),
         Medu = factor(Medu, levels = c(4, 3, 2, 1, 0), labels = c('Higher_Ed', 'Secondary', '5th_to_9th', 'Primary', 'None')),
         Mjob = as.factor(Mjob))
```



## Task 2: Summarize the Data (Very Basic EDA)

On the combined data set (`data_join2`) we look at how the data is stored and document any missing values. 

First, to look at how the data is stored, we call the tibble.

```{r}
data_join2
```

We see our 4 chosen categorical variables from Task 1 are now stored as factors. Several variables are stored as doubles where they would be better represented as characters or factors. An example is `Fedu`, the father's level of education. Since this variable takes on one of a small set of possible values, it is better represented as a categorical variable, rather than as a numeric variable as it is stored.  Other variables that would be better represented as factors or characters but are stored as doubles include `traveltime`, `studytime`, and `failures`. `famrel`, `freetime`, `goout`, `Dalc`, `Walc`, and `health` are all stored as doubles. These variables take values on a Likert-type scale, which we learned in ST 517 can be treated as numeric or categorical, but the preference in that course was to treat them as categorical. Therefore, these may be better served by being stored as characters or factors. All of the above changes in data types in the tibble could be made with the methods of Task 1. We will not do this here since we are not using these variables in this assignment. Finally, we see the G1, G2, G3, absences, and paid variables (for both .x and .y) are appropriately stored as doubles. 

Second, we can check for missing values using base R or tidyverse. First for base R.

```{r}
colSums(is.na(data_join2))
```

We see from the output that there are no missing values.

We could check the same using the tidyverse.

```{r}
sum_na <- function(v){
  sum(is.na(v))
}

data_join2 |>
  summarize(across(everything(), sum_na)) |>
  print(width = Inf)

```

Again, we find that there are no missing values in our data.

Next we do some EDA for our categorical variables. We start with a one-way contingency table using `school`. 

```{r}
table(data_join2$school)
```

The number 287 in the "GP" column is the number of students who go to the Gabriel Pereira school. From the output we see that far more students are in the "GP" school than in the "MS" school (287 vs. 33, respectively).

Now we do a two-way contingency table using `school` and `Medu`.

```{r}
table(data_join2$school, data_join2$Medu)
```

The number 114 at the intersection of the `GP` row and `Higher_Ed` column is the number of students at the "GP" school who had mothers who completed higher education. This number for the "GP" school is higher than for other education levels, suggesting that if a student goes to Gabriel Pereira, then the most likely education level of their mother is higher education. 

Next we create a three-way contingency table using `school`, `Medu`, and `Mjob`. 

```{r}
table(data_join2$school, data_join2$Medu, data_join2$Mjob)
```

We see from the output that we have a 2 by 5 by 5 array. The number at position [1,1,5] is the number of students at "GP" school whose mothers completed higher education and work as teachers. This number is 48. Examining the rest of the row containing this value, nearly all mothers of students at Gabriel Pereira who work as teachers completed higher education (specifically, all but one). 

Now we create a conditional two-way table using `table()`. We will create a two way table of `school` and `Medu` conditioned on `Mjob`. Specifically, we will condition on mothers job being teacher. We do this conditioning using two methods. 

For the first method.

```{r}
conditioned_tbl <- data_join2 |>
  filter(Mjob == 'teacher')

table(conditioned_tbl[,c('school', 'Medu')])
```

For the second method.

```{r}
table(data_join2$school, data_join2$Medu, data_join2$Mjob)[ , ,'teacher']
```

We see both methods return the same conditional two-way table. This table shows us that regardless of the school a student attends, if their mother was a teacher, then their mother was likely to have completed higher education.

Now we use `dplyr` to create a two-way contingency table. We will create the same two-way table we created above. We use the `pivot_wider()` function from `tidyr` to make the result look more like the output from `table()` function.

```{r}
data_join2 |>
  group_by(school, Medu) |>
  summarize(count = n()) |>
  pivot_wider(names_from = Medu, values_from = count)
```

We see that this is identical to the two-way table for `school` and `Medu` created above with the `table()` function, except that there is an `NA` where we want a zero. We can easily fix this with the `replace_na()` function from `tidyr` package.

```{r}
data_join2 |>
  group_by(school, Medu) |>
  summarize(count = n()) |>
  pivot_wider(names_from = Medu, values_from = count) |>
  replace_na(list(None = 0))
```

The final task we will do with categorical data is to create a stacked bar graph and side-by-side bar graph. We will do this with the variables `Medu` and `school`. 

First we create the stacked bar graph.

```{r}
data_join2 |>
  ggplot(aes(Medu)) + geom_bar(aes(fill = school)) + labs(x = 'Mother\'s Education Level', y = 'Counts', title = 'Distribution of Students\' Mother\'s Level of Education by School')
```

Next we create the side-by-side bar graph. We can use the same code but add a position argument. 

```{r}
data_join2 |>
  ggplot(aes(Medu)) + geom_bar(aes(fill = school), position = 'dodge') + labs(x = 'Mother\'s Education Level', y = 'Counts', title = 'Distribution of Students\' Mother\'s Level of Education by School')
```

Viewing the plots, we gather a lot of the same information we discussed when creating contingency tables (the numerical summary for categorical data). We can see that the mothers of students at the Gabriel Pereira school have high rates of higher education. Whereas for students at the Mousinho da Silveira school, the distribution of education levels is relatively uniform. 

Now it is time for some EDA on numeric variables. The numeric variables are age, absences, and the three test grade variables (G1, G2, and G3) from each data set (math and Portuguese). There are two each for G1, G2, G3, and absences, since there is a math value and a Portuguese value for each variable. There is only one age variable. This gives a total of 9 numeric variables in the `data_join2` data set. 

First we find measures of center and spread for 3 of these variables. We will use `absences.x`, `absences.y`, and `G3.x`. We will use mean and median as our measures of center, and we will use standard deviation (sd) and interquartile range (IQR) as our measures of spread. We return the desired values in a tibble. 

```{r}
data_join2 |>
  select(absences.x, absences.y, G3.x) |>
  summarize(across(everything(), 
            .fns = list('mean' = mean, 'median' = median, 'sd' = sd, 'IQR' = IQR),
            .names = '{.fn}_{.col}')) |>
  print(width = Inf)
```

The output suggests that students may have fewer absences and less variability in absences in Portuguese class than in math class. We of course would need to conduct a statistical test to confirm. 

We will subset the data to find measures of center and spread for only those students who had at least one absence. 

```{r}
data_join2 |>
  select(absences.x, absences.y, G3.x) |>
  filter(absences.x > 0,
         absences.y > 0) |>
  summarize(across(everything(), 
            .fns = list('mean' = mean, 'median' = median, 'sd' = sd, 'IQR' = IQR),
            .names = '{.fn}_{.col}')) |>
  print(width = Inf)
```

In this subset of students with at least one absence, we again see that students may have fewer absences and less variability in absences in Portuguese class than in math class. Like the un-subsetted case above, we would need a statistical test to confirm.

Next we find the same measures of center and spread for the same variables, but we do so across the grouping variable `school`. 

```{r}
data_join2 |>
  group_by(school) |>
  select(absences.x, absences.y, G3.x, school) |>
  summarize(across(everything(), 
            .fns = list('mean' = mean, 'median' = median, 'sd' = sd, 'IQR' = IQR),
            .names = '{.fn}_{.col}')) |>
  print(width = Inf)
```

The mean number of absences in math class appear higher for Gabriel Pereira students than Mousinho da Silveira students, and yet students in Gabriel Pereira have higher mean math scores (`G3.x`). Again, we need statistical tests to confirm these differences. 

Now we find measures of center and spread for the same 3 variables across two grouping variables: `school` and `sex`. 

```{r}
data_join2 |>
  group_by(school, sex) |>
  select(absences.x, absences.y, G3.x, school, sex) |>
  summarize(across(everything(), 
            .fns = list('mean' = mean, 'median' = median, 'sd' = sd, 'IQR' = IQR),
            .names = '{.fn}_{.col}')) |>
  print(width = Inf)
```

It appears from the output that female students at Gabriel Pereira may have lower math scores on average than male students, but that there is no difference in math scores between male and female students at Mousinho da Silveira. Again, we emphasize statistical tests are needed to assess the probability that the observed difference in mean/median test scores is do to sampling variability rather than true population differences. 

Next we create a correlation matrix between all the numeric variables.

```{r}
data_join2 |>
  select(age, G1.x, G2.x, G3.x, absences.x, G1.y, G2.y, G3.y, absences.y) |>
  cor()
```

Interestingly age is positively correlated with math class absences. Given the low absolute value of the correlation coefficient, it is a weak linear correlation. 

Next we create a histogram, kernel density plot, and boxplot for two of the numeric variables across one of the categorical variables. We will choose `absences.x` and `G3.x` as our numeric variables, and we choose sex as our categorical variable.

We first create the plots for the `absences.x` variable, starting with the histogram.

```{r}
data_join2 |>
  ggplot(aes(absences.x)) + geom_histogram(aes(fill = sex), position = 'dodge') + labs(x = 'Number of absences', y = 'Occurrence Counts', title = 'Comparison of Math Class Absences by Sex')
```

We see that some females had very long absences. We may surmise that this is due to pregnancy. If we ignore these abnormally long absences, the distribution of absences appears similar between males and females.

Next we create the kernel density plot.

```{r}
data_join2 |>
  ggplot(aes(absences.x)) + geom_density(aes(fill = sex), alpha = 0.5) + labs(x = 'Number of absences', y = 'Density', title = 'Comparison of Math Class Absences by Sex')
```

The kernel density plot gives the same information as the histogram. The distributions of math class absences are similar between males and females, other than a few female students with abnormally long absences. 

Finally we create the boxplot for math class absences by sex.

```{r}
data_join2 |>
  ggplot(aes(absences.x)) + geom_boxplot(aes(fill = sex)) + coord_flip() + labs(y = 'Sex', x = 'Number of absences', title = 'Comparison of Math Class Absences by Sex')
```

We again glean similar information from the boxplot that we gained from the histogram and density plot. The major difference is the boxplot doesn't allow us to compare distributions, only the measures of center and spread, as well as outliers.

Now we create the plots for the `G3.x` variable. 

```{r}
g <- data_join2 |> ggplot(aes(G3.x))

g + geom_histogram(aes(fill = sex), position = 'dodge') + labs(x = 'Final Math Class Grade', y = 'Occurence Counts', title = 'Comparison of Final Math Class Grade by Sex') 

g + geom_density(aes(fill = sex), alpha = 0.5) + labs(x = 'Final Math Class Grade', y = 'Density', title = 'Comparison of Final Math Class Grade by Sex')

g + geom_boxplot(aes(fill = sex)) + coord_flip() + labs(y = 'Sex', x = 'Final Math Class Grade', title = 'Comparison of Final Math Class Grade by Sex')
```

From all 3 plots, we see that males tend to have higher final math class scores than females.

Next, we create two scatterplots relating `G3.x` to `age` and `G3.x` to `absences.x`. We jitter the points and color the points by the categorical variable `sex`. 

```{r}
g <- data_join2 |> ggplot()

g + geom_point(aes(x = age, y = G3.x, color = sex), position = 'jitter') + labs(x = 'Age', y = 'Final Math Class Score', title = 'Final Math Class Score versus Age')

g + geom_point(aes(x = absences.x, y = G3.x, color = sex), position = 'jitter') + labs(x = 'Number of Math Class Absences', y = 'Final Math Class Score', title = 'Final Math Class Score versus Math Class Absences')
```

From the plot, there does not appear to be a relationship between final math class score and age. There may be a negative relationship between number of math class absences and final math class score, particularly for males. 

Now we repeat the scatter plot step but use faceting to obtain graphs at each level of the variable `Medu`. We just copy the previous code and add a facet layer.

```{r}
g <- data_join2 |> ggplot()

g + geom_point(aes(x = age, y = G3.x, color = sex), position = 'jitter') + labs(x = 'Age', y = 'Final Math Class Score', title = 'Final Math Class Score versus Age by Mother\'s Education level') + facet_wrap(~Medu)

g + geom_point(aes(x = absences.x, y = G3.x, color = sex), position = 'jitter') + labs(x = 'Number of Math Class Absences', y = 'Final Math Class Score', title = 'Final Math Class Score versus Math Class Absences by Mother\'s Education Level') + facet_wrap(~Medu)
```

Again, there does not appear to be a relationship between final math class score and age. And there may be a negative relationship between number of math class absences and final math class score.

To conclude this assignment, we repeat the previous step but use two categorical variables in faceting. We again use `Medu` and we now also include `Mjob`. 

```{r}
g <- data_join2 |> ggplot()

g + geom_point(aes(x = age, y = G3.x, color = sex), position = 'jitter') + labs(x = 'Age', y = 'Final Math Class Score', title = 'Final Math Class Score versus Age by Mother\'s Education level and Job') + facet_wrap(Medu ~ Mjob)

g + geom_point(aes(x = absences.x, y = G3.x, color = sex), position = 'jitter') + labs(x = 'Number of Math Class Absences', y = 'Final Math Class Score', title = 'Final Math Class Score versus Math Class Absences by Mother\'s Education Level and Job') + facet_wrap(Medu ~ Mjob)
```

The relationship between final math class score and number of math class absences is less clear after faceting on two categorical variables, except for perhaps the category of "Higher_Ed" and "other", where the negative relationship persists.
